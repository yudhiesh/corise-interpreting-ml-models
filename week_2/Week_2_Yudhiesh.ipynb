        "As a data scientist at a movie streaming company, you've been tasked with finding ways to improve the platform's movie recommendation system. One of the biggest challenges is understanding how users feel about the movies they watch. Sure, you can look at the star ratings they give, but those aren't always the most informative. That's why you've decided to dig deeper and use interpretable AI to analyze movie reviews and understand the sentiment behind them.\n",

        "You are given a NLP model that is trained on millions of tweets that are not necessarily movie reviews. The models extract features such as the presence of certain words or phrases that might indicate a positive or negative opinion and gives you a sentiment of a review based on these features. But the model's predictions aren't enough for you. You want to understand why it's making the predictions it is. So you use interpretable AI techniques like LIME and SHAP to get an understanding of the most important factors that drive a positive or negative opinion.\n",

        "With this information in hand, your aim is to create a visualization that clearly illustrates the key factors that drive positive or negative opinions about a film. This way, you and the team can easily identify which movies are likely to be well-received by users and which ones are likely to be overlooked. By using interpretable AI to understand movie reviews, your goal is to create a powerful tool that will help the company make better movie recommendations and keep users coming back for more awesome content. Good luck on this journey!"
